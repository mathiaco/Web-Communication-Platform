VEN 16:32

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff I separated all our user stories into individual issues and labelled them as user stories
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
If we decide we don't like it, then we can change it up.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Should we be refining them further (like the TA suggested)?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Also everyone should create their own branch like the TA said
Yeah there were a few that we had to be more specific about. (I didn't change that though)
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
In the morning meeting did we prioritize any user stories for sprint 2?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Not yet
I'm guess the login page will be done in sprint 2 and a couple other things
We have to discuss people's programming abilities and assess how fast we can bang out these stories
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
That makes sense. Are using a framework or are we coding everything from scratch (i.e. jss, html, css)
I guess I am just trying to figure out what I can do before next friday.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Well I suggest at least using bootstrap.... Because it'll make our life easier, and I'm lazy
I'm not super aware of Angular.js and Node.js like other people suggested
We haven't really talked about frameworks and such yet
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
I've been looking at react for front end and it seems to be easier to work in groups with because u can create components that don't conflict with each other
so for example one person can work on the side   bar and another on the header without conflictkng
but we would have to use node for back end
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Should I make a poll asking people what languages they know?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Sure and maybe if they are familiar with react/node/angular
I.e. any of the libraries/frameworks mentiones
DIM 15:23

Mathiaco-lee
I have a free one year of domain privacy
.com/ .net /.org
it might be able to use that
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
DIM 17:32

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
So what's our goal for Friday?
We should really decide on what frameworks we're using
DIM 18:53

Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
whatever you want guys!! doesnt matter for me
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I hoestly don't know enough about frameworks to have informed opinion. If there are group members that have opinions I am happy to go along with a decision and learn to use the framework.
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
^ not that experienced with frameworks so those who are can decide and ill start learning
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Or if none of us know, I am happy to research ones that were identified and discuss them.
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
Also for friday he wanted to see that we looked into the github api
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Another thing we might need to thing about are which user stories we are prioritising for sprint two so we can start splitting up and creating tasks.
As in he wants us to look at how the api might be useful?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
from what I'm seeing it's easier to learn PHP than node.js for the backend
but node.js is easier to host and better performance
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Do any of you know ruby on rails? Just curious as I have heard it being used often in the context of web apps
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w/playlists
Mindspace
There's always something to learn! Whether you want to have look at Angular 2 Tutorials or Guides, WordPress Tutorials, CSS/JavaScript Tutorials or anything ...
youtube.com
this guy has good videos for node/angular/react
MER 21:38

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Did any of you have a look at the grading scheme for sprint 2?
Mathiaco-lee
yess
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am little concerned that we have quite a bit to do.
In prep for Friday do each of us want to take on a few of the user stories for line 5 and line 6 of the grading for sprint 2?
Or do you all prefer to just work on it in a group?
At Friday's meeting I mean.
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I think there wont be much time before the tutorial on Friday
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am worried about the same thing.
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
So we should work on it at least tom
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I've been working on a rough draft of the website
like, how it looks.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
A wireframe?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
no, more than that
like actually coding it up
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
What frame work
Are u using
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
bootstrap
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am not sure who it was that had the outline for our work on paper from last Friday but was that uploaded?
Also, did we decided on Bootstrap as our framework?
*decide
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
can we decide if what we are going to use for front/back end of the project
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am assuming the first is what you have been testing out?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
What?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
The first image
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I haven't done any backend
this is purely UI
with placeholders
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
That looks great!
I am really concerned, however, about meeting the requirements of the second sprint, which really requires us to drill down on the user stories.
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
second sprint is next friday
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
^
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Not this friday then
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Is anyone good at design in this group?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Design like for 2D
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
For webpages in general
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I know the second sprint is not till next Friday but I don't think the work is going to be done in a short period of time.
I also tend to be pretty busy so it's hard for me to do things last minute. I don't mind if other people want to work on their part later, I would just prefer to divide up the work at least
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Yeahh it will be great to know who do what
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah i agree
Too
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
So are we deciding this stuff Friday?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
we should figure out the languages we use
then it would be much easier to determine the work everyone has to do
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Could we at least divide up the user stories and come in on Friday, each having looked at: 
Story description, Points, Risk, Priority, with burndown chart and Task breakdown for our user stories.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Yeah
Well there's like half of us that are able to meet on Friday right after class
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so for those of us that can't meet, can they post their part on gitHub for their selected user stories by Friday so at least we have their part to work with?
Perhaps we can choose the user stories we each on want to work on and mark that on github so we don't do doubles at least.
Mathiaco-lee
yeah that's a good plan
i am interested in the stories related to the using the Github API
JEU 11:46

Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Guys we need to plan things today
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Yeahhh
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Am at school if anybody is willing to join me
I'll make a plan and assign work that needs to be done and everybody can fill the task(s) they feel like they can do
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I created a file called framework
In code
Can everybody go there and fell it with the languages they know
And next to that their name
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Where is the file
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
In code
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Ok
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
done!!
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Please feel free to look up the tasks file
And update it since i am a little busy to write all the tasks we  need to do
Whenever we do a task we can write it over there and the contributors to it
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Guys we are going to decide the framework by 6 tonight
jeudi 9 février, à 18:00
Le groupe recevra aussi un rappel 30 min avant.
Yousef a créé un rappel pour l’évènement.
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am goid with what ivan said
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Dude its 1 o clock
Diyaan Athar

Meeting chat records [21/2/2017]
Hi!
Jeff
Hello
:D
Mathiaco-lee
Hi
Emanuel
hi
Jeff, what has your progress been since Saturday?
And what are you hoping to get done by Saturday?
Jeff
I've watched all the nodejs videos Ivan gave me, and today I'm working posts
Ariles
Where are u ?!!
Where are you hoping to be at with this by the upcoming Saturday ?
Online...
Jeff
Tomorrow I want to see if we can create the database, and hopefully added the post to the database when the submit button is clicked
Ariles
Is not a person meeting?!
Jeff
I think Ariles is at school
Yousef
Am at school
Ariles
Yeahh i am at school
Okay, you and I can confer on this tomorrow!
Nathan how about you?
Emanuel
speaking of the database i've been doing some research and it looks like firebase is better suited to what we need, since it is better when real-time updates to the clients are required
Are you working on a particular user story?
Does anybody else know about firebase?
Jeff
I agree with firebase!
And I know how to use firebase 🙂
Emanuel
nice
Jeff
thank god
one less thing to learn
And google has some nice SHORT tutorial videos about it
Is there are consensus on this?
Mathiaco-lee
Good for me
Nathan?
Yousef?
Yousef
I guess everybody agrees on it
Arriles?
Yousef
Honestly I don't know what  firebase is
Do you know what Mongo DB is, or are they same for you?
Jeff
Firebase is just an online database made by google
Yousef, are you working on a particular story line?
Sorry I mean user story!
Yousef
Yeah the group pages
Okay, so where are you at with that?
Not trying to be mean 😕
Yousef
Almost done finishing the languages
I need
Jeff
I suggest everyone use the "Project" tab on github
I created a SCRUM board there to help keep track of what everyone is doing
Yousef, when do think you will be able to hav the React components done for the group page?
Jeff
You can drag and drop your User Story by clicking "Add Cards" and then drag and drop it
Cool! Thanks Jeff 🙂
Yousef
I should be able to let u know by after tom
Ariles
I dont know firebase !!
But you do know Mongo DB?
Ariles
Neither
But its fine
Jeff
:P
So is it the same for for you to use them Ariles?
Ariles
Use what?!
Database ?!
Firebase verses MongoDB
As in does it make a difference?
Ariles
Ohh yeahh in either case i need to learn one
Okay, whoever said they had a video tutorial can you please post it to the chat?
Ariles
You can use this website slant.io
To compare which one is the best
Slant.co
Mathiaco-lee, are you working on a user story?
Mathiaco-lee
On the github profile info and activities
Jeff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1D0_wFlXgo&t
Mathiaco-lee
I've started coding
What part are you coding? Do you have the React JS part up and running?
Mathiaco-lee
Not yet
Jeff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwNATxfUsgI&t
Do you think you will have that by Saturday?
Jeff
Actually I'll post these in the group.
THey'll get lost in the chat
Mathiaco-lee
I'll try my best
Thanks Mathiaco-lee! and also thanks Jeff!
Ariles, are you working on a user story?
Sorry y'all harassment will be over soon
Mathiaco-lee
Jeff these are the firebase videos ?
Hey Emanuel, are you working on a user story?
Emanuel
working on the user stories that allow real time chat between people
Jeff
Ok so I posted to useful videos about Firebase in the group page
There's plenty more on youtube that you can find
Emanuel
Nathan and I were able to get a basic functional chat down
and now we would need to connect to a database and find the best way to save chat files
Mathiaco-lee
Thanks
Do you think you will have that down by Saturday or you think that you will need more time?
Emanuel
Probably need a bit more time
Okay, so as an estimate, I will put down next Tuesday as a hope to get finished time. Is that okay?
Emanuel
sure
Ariles, where are you?
Mathiaco-lee
Does anyone have an idea of what is needed for Sprint 3 other than progress ?
Nope, just checking the site rn.
Nothing there on sprint 3 as of yet!
Okay, I think we are done, I gonna just transfer this to the meeting notes. Does anybody else have anything else they need to follow up on?
Emanuel
nope
Mathiaco-lee
Guess we will catch up on Saturday at 8 PM
Mathiaco-lee
Oh Yousef are you still doing the Burndown chart ?
Jeff, where to we do this dragging. I am super confused?
Jeff
Go to github
Click the Project tab
Then click "SCRUM Board"
The top right there's a button that says "Add Cards"
Cool, I can see it!
What does icebox mean?
Do all our user stories start ther?
Jeff
Technically every User Story we plan on doing should be in there
It's User stories that are waiting to be worked on
Okay got it! I will transfer them over
Nathan I think Emanuel gave us an update on the user story him and you are working on
Did you want to add anything?
Nathan
ya im reading srry im late
Np, it happens
Ivan I see you there 😛
Thanks for organizing the project folders
Which user stories precisely are you working on?
Ivan
Hey im back
Me?
Yup, you
Ivan
Working on the github stuff
You mean log-in with Mathiaco?
Ivan
Yeah
The login and creating a profile for the user
Jeff
Ivan I think the login isn't working anymore
Ivan
It works, sign out of github and u'll see
What will you have done by Saturday?
Jeff
oh yeah wow
cool
Did you change it?
Ivan
Sessions + profile page creation
Jeff
It doesn't show in the revoke page
Ivan
And I'll try to get the database stuff working
Jeff
We're using Firebase now I think
Ivan
I think its because it only asks for ur public info
Jeff
instead of MongoDB
Ah ok
Ivan
Ok
Does anyone want to setup the database stuff or should I do it?
Jeff
As in creating the database?
Ivan
Yeah
One thing I am really confused about is don't we need one database?
Jeff
Yeah
Ivan
Yeah
Correct
Jeff is that something you and I want to work on tomorrow since you already know how it works?
....just a suggestions...
Jeff
Sure
Okay, so how about once Jeff and I have met tomorrow we send everyone an update on what is going on with that?
I am guessing it is going to be pertinent to what you and Emanuel are doing also Nathan?
Nathan
yeah, well we havent really looked at any of the database stuff yet.
but thats what we are missing
Ivan
Database is very pertinent to all the aspects of the site
Okay, so Jeff and I will give y'all an update once we have met?
Ivan
Ok
Jeff
People need a Google account in order for me to add them to the database as Admins
as in a @gmail.com email

Do you think by Saturday you might have the React components done (or if not Saturday, then next Tuesday)
Or if neither of those, then what date is realistic?
Ariles
Ariles
Yeahhh it will be done !!
Perfect, thanks 🙂
Jeff
Ok so everyone should be able to see the database at https://console.firebase.google.com/
Firebase Console
Firebase is a mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money.
accounts.google.com
Just look at it when you have the time
Ariles
Sorry, is there a way to down load the chat file, just want to update documentation
Or did we just copy-paste last time?
I mean from facebook, sorry if that was confusing?
Mathiaco-lee
