Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I separated all our user stories into individual issues and labelled them as user stories
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
If we decide we don't like it, then we can change it up.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Should we be refining them further (like the TA suggested)?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Also everyone should create their own branch like the TA said
Yeah there were a few that we had to be more specific about. (I didn't change that though)
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
In the morning meeting did we prioritize any user stories for sprint 2?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Not yet
I'm guess the login page will be done in sprint 2 and a couple other things
We have to discuss people's programming abilities and assess how fast we can bang out these stories
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
That makes sense. Are using a framework or are we coding everything from scratch (i.e. jss, html, css)
I guess I am just trying to figure out what I can do before next friday.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Well I suggest at least using bootstrap.... Because it'll make our life easier, and I'm lazy
I'm not super aware of Angular.js and Node.js like other people suggested
We haven't really talked about frameworks and such yet
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
I've been looking at react for front end and it seems to be easier to work in groups with because u can create components that don't conflict with each other
so for example one person can work on the side   bar and another on the header without conflictkng
but we would have to use node for back end
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Should I make a poll asking people what languages they know?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Sure and maybe if they are familiar with react/node/angular
I.e. any of the libraries/frameworks mentiones
DIM 15:23

Mathiaco-lee
I have a free one year of domain privacy
.com/ .net /.org
it might be able to use that
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
DIM 17:32

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
So what's our goal for Friday?
We should really decide on what frameworks we're using
DIM 18:53

Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
whatever you want guys!! doesnt matter for me
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I hoestly don't know enough about frameworks to have informed opinion. If there are group members that have opinions I am happy to go along with a decision and learn to use the framework.
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
^ not that experienced with frameworks so those who are can decide and ill start learning
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Or if none of us know, I am happy to research ones that were identified and discuss them.
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
Also for friday he wanted to see that we looked into the github api
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Another thing we might need to thing about are which user stories we are prioritising for sprint two so we can start splitting up and creating tasks.
As in he wants us to look at how the api might be useful?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
from what I'm seeing it's easier to learn PHP than node.js for the backend
but node.js is easier to host and better performance
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Do any of you know ruby on rails? Just curious as I have heard it being used often in the context of web apps
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel

Mindspace
There's always something to learn! Whether you want to have look at Angular 2 Tutorials or Guides, WordPress Tutorials, CSS/JavaScript Tutorials or anything ...
youtube.com
this guy has good videos for node/angular/react
MER 21:38

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Did any of you have a look at the grading scheme for sprint 2?
Mathiaco-lee
yess
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am little concerned that we have quite a bit to do.
In prep for Friday do each of us want to take on a few of the user stories for line 5 and line 6 of the grading for sprint 2?
Or do you all prefer to just work on it in a group?
At Friday's meeting I mean.
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I think there wont be much time before the tutorial on Friday
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am worried about the same thing.
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
So we should work on it at least tom
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I've been working on a rough draft of the website
like, how it looks.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
A wireframe?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
no, more than that
like actually coding it up
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
What frame work
Are u using
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
bootstrap
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am not sure who it was that had the outline for our work on paper from last Friday but was that uploaded?
Also, did we decided on Bootstrap as our framework?
*decide
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
can we decide if what we are going to use for front/back end of the project
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am assuming the first is what you have been testing out?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
What?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
The first image
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I haven't done any backend
this is purely UI
with placeholders
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
That looks great!
I am really concerned, however, about meeting the requirements of the second sprint, which really requires us to drill down on the user stories.
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
second sprint is next friday
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
^
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Not this friday then
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Is anyone good at design in this group?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Design like for 2D
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
For webpages in general
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I know the second sprint is not till next Friday but I don't think the work is going to be done in a short period of time.
I also tend to be pretty busy so it's hard for me to do things last minute. I don't mind if other people want to work on their part later, I would just prefer to divide up the work at least
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Yeahh it will be great to know who do what
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah i agree
Too
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
So are we deciding this stuff Friday?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
we should figure out the languages we use
then it would be much easier to determine the work everyone has to do
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Could we at least divide up the user stories and come in on Friday, each having looked at: 
Story description, Points, Risk, Priority, with burndown chart and Task breakdown for our user stories.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Yeah
Well there's like half of us that are able to meet on Friday right after class
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so for those of us that can't meet, can they post their part on gitHub for their selected user stories by Friday so at least we have their part to work with?
Perhaps we can choose the user stories we each on want to work on and mark that on github so we don't do doubles at least.
Mathiaco-lee
yeah that's a good plan
i am interested in the stories related to the using the Github API
JEU 11:46

Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Guys we need to plan things today
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Yeahhh
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Am at school if anybody is willing to join me
I'll make a plan and assign work that needs to be done and everybody can fill the task(s) they feel like they can do
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I created a file called framework
In code
Can everybody go there and fell it with the languages they know
And next to that their name
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Where is the file
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
In code
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Ok
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
done!!
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Please feel free to look up the tasks file
And update it since i am a little busy to write all the tasks we  need to do
Whenever we do a task we can write it over there and the contributors to it
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Guys we are going to decide the framework by 6 tonight
jeudi 9 février, à 18:00
Le groupe recevra aussi un rappel 30 min avant.
