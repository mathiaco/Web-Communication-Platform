Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, you and I can confer on this tomorrow!
Nathan how about you?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
speaking of the database i've been doing some research and it looks like firebase is better suited to what we need, since it is better when real-time updates to the clients are required
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Are you working on a particular user story?
Does anybody else know about firebase?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I agree with firebase!
And I know how to use firebase 🙂
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Nathan?
Yousef?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I guess everybody agrees on it
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Arriles?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Honestly I don't know what  firebase is
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Do you know what Mongo DB is, or are they same for you?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Firebase is just an online database made by google
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Yousef, are you working on a particular story line?
Sorry I mean user story!
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah the group pages
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so where are you at with that?
Not trying to be mean 😕
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Almost done finishing the languages
I need
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I suggest everyone use the "Project" tab on github
I created a SCRUM board there to help keep track of what everyone is doing
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Yousef, when do think you will be able to hav the React components done for the group page?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
You can drag and drop your User Story by clicking "Add Cards" and then drag and drop it
Diyaan Athar

Yousef Shaker
Yousef

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
So is it the same for for you to use them Ariles?
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Use what?!
Database ?!
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Firebase verses MongoDB
As in does it make a difference?
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Ohh yeahh in either case i need to learn one
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, whoever said they had a video tutorial can you please post it to the chat?
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles

To compare which one is the best
Slant.co
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Mathiaco-lee, are you working on a user story?
Mathiaco-lee

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan

Ariles, are you working on a user story?
Sorry y'all harassment will be over soon
Mathiaco-lee
Jeff these are the firebase videos ?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Hey Emanuel, are you working on a user story?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
working on the user stories that allow real time chat between people
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Ok so I posted to useful videos about Firebase in the group page
There's plenty more on youtube that you can find
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
Nathan and I were able to get a basic functional chat down
and now we would need to connect to a database and find the best way to save chat files
Mathiaco-lee
Thanks
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Do you think you will have that down by Saturday or you think that you will need more time?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
Probably need a bit more time
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so as an estimate, I will put down next Tuesday as a hope to get finished time. Is that okay?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
sure
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Ariles, where are you?
Mathiaco-lee
Does anyone have an idea of what is needed for Sprint 3 other than progress ?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Nope, just checking the site rn.
Nothing there on sprint 3 as of yet!
Okay, I think we are done, I gonna just transfer this to the meeting notes. Does anybody else have anything else they need to follow up on?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
nope
Mathiaco-lee
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Guess we will catch up on Saturday at 8 PM
Mathiaco-lee
Oh Yousef are you still doing the Burndown chart ?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Jeff, where to we do this dragging. I am super confused?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Go to github
Click the Project tab
Then click "SCRUM Board"
The top right there's a button that says "Add Cards"
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Cool, I can see it!
What does icebox mean?
Do all our user stories start ther?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Technically every User Story we plan on doing should be in there
It's User stories that are waiting to be worked on
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay got it! I will transfer them over
Nathan I think Emanuel gave us an update on the user story him and you are working on
Did you want to add anything?
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
ya im reading srry im late
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Np, it happens
Ivan I see you there 😛
Thanks for organizing the project folders
Which user stories precisely are you working on?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Hey im back
Me?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Yup, you
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Working on the github stuff
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
You mean log-in with Mathiaco?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Yeah
The login and creating a profile for the user
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Ivan I think the login isn't working anymore
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
It works, sign out of github and u'll see
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
What will you have done by Saturday?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
oh yeah wow
cool
Did you change it?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Sessions + profile page creation
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
It doesn't show in the revoke page
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
And I'll try to get the database stuff working
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
We're using Firebase now I think
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
I think its because it only asks for ur public info
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
instead of MongoDB
Ah ok
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Ok
Does anyone want to setup the database stuff or should I do it?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
As in creating the database?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Yeah
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
One thing I am really confused about is don't we need one database?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Yeah
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Yeah
Correct
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Jeff is that something you and I want to work on tomorrow since you already know how it works?
....just a suggestions...
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Sure
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so how about once Jeff and I have met tomorrow we send everyone an update on what is going on with that?
I am guessing it is going to be pertinent to what you and Emanuel are doing also Nathan?
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
yeah, well we havent really looked at any of the database stuff yet.
but thats what we are missing
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Database is very pertinent to all the aspects of the site
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so Jeff and I will give y'all an update once we have met?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Ok
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
People need a Google account in order for me to add them to the database as Admins

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I'm on my way to school
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Great! You and I are meeting at 11 right?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Ugh, sorry jeff I am running late. It might be 11:30 by the time I get there. Sorry 😞
Jeff Buonamici

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Ivan is the token you receive from gitHub stored in a cookie?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Right now its not stored anywhere
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Then how does it know if we are logged in or not
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
It doesn't xD
You can get in without logging in
There's no sessions or cookies or verifications
But it gets an access token from github
Right now the access token is just written to the console and it disappears
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
But technically the access token could be stored and reused?
Do we get  a different access token every time we login?
Nathan & Emanuel, do you get a chance to integrate your chat with the overall website. If not, could you please do this by Saturday at the very latest as it would be great to see it and how it fits in with the rest of the site.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Please carefully read the post I made on the group page as it details what you need to do by our Saturday meeting. Please come prepared.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am going through the user stories, and some of you still have not fixed up your user stories. Each user story needs to have a description, and an accurate task breakdown besides it.
Ivan & Mathiaco: You have been assigned to user stories #14, #16, #17. Your user stories have not been touched so could you please make sure that they meet all the criteria above by Saturday 8 PM.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I'll look at it when I get home
I didn't touch any of mine either I think
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Perfect, thanks Jeff!
Matuese and Nathan: you guys are set 🙂
Ariles, you are assigned to User Story#22. Your user story has also not been touched. Please make sure that it meets all the criteria I mentioned above by Saturday 8 PM.
Yousef: You have no user stories in the In Progress part of the SCRUM board
The link to the SCRUM Board is here: https://goo.gl/QTfEQZ

Please move the user story you are working on from the Icebox to the In Progress section. Also please make sure your user story has: a description, and actual task breakdown.
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Okay
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Thanks Yousef!
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Hi y'all, since I am in full harassment mode, I uploaded a task list to our Facebook page based on our conversations. Please make sure you come to our Saturday meeting prepared.
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Awesome job!
22 FÉVRIER 22:43

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I was taking a look at our overall sprints, and the sprint we have coming up is focussed on features so I think we should really be pushing ourselves to get the site functional over the next week and a half.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Ok
24 FÉVRIER 17:04

Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Hey did anyone have any success with Firebase? I can't figure it out
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
What's confusing you
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
I can't get it to put anything in the database
I've been messing around with it for a few hours today and yesterday
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Have you watched tutorials?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
yeah
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
You added the code that connects it to the db?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Do you get errors when you try to store data?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
got it to work 😀
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
What was wrong
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
It was giving me initializatiogn errors
either my code was initializing twice
or it was trying to run withotu initializing
I kinda quickfixed it
but it worked 😀
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
How?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yaw guys i want to update my branch but whenever i switch to another branch to make a pull request it trlls me aborting
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I think someone else needs to pull
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
aborting?
what does it say exactly
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
When I switch from master to my branch it shows me this

Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
try git stash
then switch
> git stash
> git checkout your-branch
Yousef Shaker
Yousef

This appeared when u stash
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
I have no idea
lol
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Omg
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
do u have any changes on ur branch u need?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I want to update my branch
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
you want your branch to be synced with master?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah
Just a sec i think i figured it
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout <YOUR-BRANCH>
git merge master
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Will am trying to do that
But i cant switch
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
you can't git checkout master?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
thats wierd
google it
it shouldnt be a problem
if anythign you can always make a new branch
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
You can use the GUI version of git if you want
I find it easier
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Will i am learning
But i think i found the problem
Since this is concordia's computer it has limited disk
So i deleted the files
And it worked fine
But i still can t switch due to
Memory consumption
I did a pull request
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
lol
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Ivan if i want to change my file
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
dude
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Sorry
I know
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
we can't merge because you're changing a file taht is long gone
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Its supposed
So should i delete
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
just delete yeah
and clone the repo again
and start a new branch
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Done

25 FÉVRIER 20:01

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Is anyone around?
Mathiaco-lee
yuup
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Yeah
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, we will wait a couple of minutes before getting started I guess?
Okay so Mathiaco-lee are you working with Ivan?
I saw your name on the same user stories as Ivan so I am wondering if you are working with him or independently?
Mathiaco-lee
I've been working on some stuff but we'll merge it
there's some stuff i want done first
but I am not done yet
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Could you tell me exactly what you are working on?
Mathiaco-lee
so Ivan is that alright with you
?
the profile info and activities taken from github
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
But you haven't talked to Ivan about what he is doing?
What is you both are doubling up on work?
*if?
And what exactly have you done for these user stories?
Mathiaco-lee
we both said what we would do
here
and it seemed different
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
So what exactly have you done and Ivan what exactly have you done?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
am here
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Hi Yousef, just doing check-ins with everyone 🙂
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
well basically i finished html and css
and now i have an idea
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Just one sec Yousef
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
kk
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I think Mathiaco-Lee and Ivan were giving updates on their user stories
Mathiaco, what exactly have you done? [i.e. React, HTML, CSS, Firebase]
And for which pages?
Mathiaco-lee
the user story that is saying i want my github activity available on profile
node.js and then firebase
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so not the log-in page. I think you are working on that right Ivan?
Mathiaco-lee
yes he did it
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Perfect. So what is remaining on that user story and when will have you that code-base ready to merge with the rest of the teams?
I am asking as I am pretty sure in our next sprint we will need to demonstrate features of our site.
Mathiaco-lee
I updated the user stories last time with description and task list
next meeting is on Tuesday
i think I'll be good
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
So you will have it ready to merge by Tuesday?
Mathiaco-lee
yes
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
:)
Awesome, I will right you down for that.
Sorry Ivan you are up next, where are you at?
*write
Nathan is Emanuel around?
Sorry who is around?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay Yousef, which user story are you working on?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
am working on the group page
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
What part of the group page?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
joining groups
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
And I guess creating groups?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
yeah
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
And where are you at?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
well for me i finished 46 tutorials on html and css
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
:0
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
i have an idea on how to do them now
but i ll be a little rusty
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Are you working with someone else on this, or on your own?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
since its my first time
doing web programming
my own
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Totally understandable, are you working with someone else?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
alone
I have a question
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Eeeeek! I am a little worried, because time is kind of short and I don't know if you are going to get it done by the next sprint
Sure
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
no worries
i can get it done niw
now
if i want to
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so do you think by next Saturday you might have something to show us?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
withing the couple of days coming i should be good
Within
like on monday
or by our meeting on tuesday
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Did you get a chance to fix up the user stories?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
??
what do u mean
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Did you see the Task List on our facebook page?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
yeah
ah
okay
so its really realtive with web  being done
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Huh?
What do you mean?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
i can add it up while doing the website
since i ll have a view
a more concise view
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Could you please do it asap because we keep loosing marks for stuff like not having our documentation in order and it sucks balls
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Its already done
but am saying
it will get updated
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, cool. Also did you get a chance to look at Firebase stuff yet or no?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
not really
I guess it would be counterproductive for me to deal with it
because i still have to learn it
too
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so you would like someone else to work with the DB part of your user story?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I prefer alone
I am lone wolf
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, but just to let you know, those two user stories need to be done by the next sprint so if you feel like you are running out of time, let any of us know and we can help out
:)
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
yeah
when is our next sprint
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Arilles, I know you sent me a message, where are you at with your user story?
It is not this Friday but the Friday after I believe
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
okay
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan

Mathiaco-lee
Right*
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
There is a quizz no way?!!
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
hi guys sorry im late
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
So Ariles when do you think you will have your part done?
Emanuel, what's the progress with your and Nathan's user story?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
we will still need to implement the chat to the main site didnt have time to do it yet, we have been really busy but itll easily be done before next meeting
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Did you get a chance to look at the database?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
no not yet plan on looking through the stuff tomorrow
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Could you and Nathan please all the stuff in the task list (on our Facebook Page) by Tuesday, our grade for last sprint sucked balls and I don't want us to continue sucking. I am pretty sure in our next sprint we will have to show features. I am pretty stress.
*stressed
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
the next sprint is in two weeks
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
yeah, that is not much time
at least not in my opinion, if we get done early, all the better for us but i don't think we have a good record on that
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
i mean we are basically done what we have to do, just some fine tuning and adding it to the site
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
you integrated it with the db?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
the site/database
thats simple enough to do
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Great, so you will have it done by Tuesday?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
most probably
which is when i orignally said i would have it done
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Great!
Ivan or Nathan or Jeff are any of you around?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
Nathan is trying to get home has no data
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, no problem. You gave an update of where you both are with the user story anyway. Does anyone have the contact for Ivan or Jeff?
Mathiaco-lee
I don't
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Neither !
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Guess nobody does. I will try to follow up with them and post updates.
Does anybody have any concerns they wanna bring up?
If not, I guess our next meeting is in person on Tuesday
@ 1 PM
Mathiaco-lee
Okay
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Hey sorry. I'm up north at the cottage and the basement flooded a bit and then we tried to pump out the water but the pipe was frozen 😑 so I've been dealing with that
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
No problem, can you just send us an update re: to do list and our user story, I am working on the React for it.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
My to do list is adding posts to the database when they're created by the user

Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yaw guys just to see if am on the right side

Yousef Shaker
Yousef

Am doing something like this
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Look at the code of group.html it gives u the box!
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I did
The files no longer contain the
Template
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Hmm
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
The template is on github
I created the group page layout basically
27 FÉVRIER 13:15

Yousef Shaker
Yousef
okay ill go with that
27 FÉVRIER 23:16

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Are we meeting in person tomorrow, or are we meeting up online
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am okay with either
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I would rather do online, I have a project due on Thursday that I need to work on.
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
No i dont agree
We said we re gonna meet in person
I dont like changing our  thoughts from one time to another
If any of us cant make then they re excused
28 FÉVRIER 01:27

Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
im in school anyways
28 FÉVRIER 10:49

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am guessing we are meeting in person then?
28 FÉVRIER 11:49

Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay I will be there, h823?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah i guess
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Ok
Mathiaco-lee
Sorry but I won't make it
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Im omw
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Mathiaco-lee, could you please send an update. I think you had said you would merge your section by today.
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
I missed my bus so I'll probably be there around 20 minutes later
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I will be there in 5
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
ok
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
I wont be there in person unfortunately, but ill be here online if you have any questions
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Did you integrate your chat with our system?
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
We tried and were having issues
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
we have to wrok on those
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am not surprised
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
it ended up messing up what was already there
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Could you figure it out by saturday. We need functionality in our site by the next sprint.
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
We think its because the site isnt in react
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
What do you mean?
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
is emanuel there yet?
The site is written in html/css and not react
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Im in h-823
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
No
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Btw do we have a quiz tom
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Hi all, I am feeling really frustrated by our lack of progress and feeling really nervous about the fact that we have a sprint coming up. We did really poorly (compared to other teams) on our last sprint and I don't want to repeat this.
I completely understand that everyone is busy, and honestly I am not trying to be mean, I would just like to do reasonably well.
Do any of you have any suggestions for how we can progress?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah i do
First we dont need to be fancy with our website
We need it to work properly
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Agreed
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Thats why we need the people who voted for the languages to do their parts
Honestly am trying my best to learn as much as i can
So that i can work on the website
And i have started
For me am doing the best i can do
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Can we schedule a joint work sessions so that we can share our knowledge with each other and to allow for integration?
I don't mind scheduling two alternative times, and just making it mandatory to attend one if it is hard to make both sessions.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Also Ivan, there is a slight change you might need to make. Our site is supposed to allow the TA to access github information right? Regardless of whether the user is signed in or not. Does the token expire? If the token expires we are going to need to store information from the github in our db so that it can be accessed later when the TA needs to see it. Does it make sense?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Also, can everyone please answer my question re: joint work session?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
you see the problem isn't that the people who suggested the languages aren't doing anything
we are actively trying to get the site tonwork
nothing fancy about it
it's the people that have taken over a month to learn the languages that need to start implementing their stuff
or else we are going to end up falling behind even further
we had to learn the languages the same just as everybody else
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Why did u guys agree on languages u dont know then
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
because it's not that hard to learn languages and according to the research we did it's the best way to integrate the site
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Well if its not hard then we is most o f us slagging off and not even showing up to the meeting we re supposed to have
Only 4 of us show up
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
that has nothing to do with learning the languages
that has to do with project execution
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Brah r u for real
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Guys, when is our quiz?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I don't see anything on Moodle about a quiz
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
normally the teacher is supposed to send an email one week before the test
thats what he did
for quizz 1
1 MARS 15:30

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Ariles and Yousef, y'all okay?
Just wanted to check in cause of evacuations and all.
Yousef Shaker

Burndown chart
MER 19:41

Mathiaco-lee

Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Good job good job
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel

Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
We made the uml diagram and referenced some commits
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I made the architecture
JEU 21:42

Mathiaco-lee
Are we missing anything else ?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
We re only missing the integration
Can somebody look at the architecture
JEU 23:13

Mathiaco-lee

Yousef Shaker
Yousef

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff

VEN 16:32

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff I separated all our user stories into individual issues and labelled them as user stories
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
If we decide we don't like it, then we can change it up.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Should we be refining them further (like the TA suggested)?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Also everyone should create their own branch like the TA said
Yeah there were a few that we had to be more specific about. (I didn't change that though)
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
In the morning meeting did we prioritize any user stories for sprint 2?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Not yet
I'm guess the login page will be done in sprint 2 and a couple other things
We have to discuss people's programming abilities and assess how fast we can bang out these stories
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
That makes sense. Are using a framework or are we coding everything from scratch (i.e. jss, html, css)
I guess I am just trying to figure out what I can do before next friday.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Well I suggest at least using bootstrap.... Because it'll make our life easier, and I'm lazy
I'm not super aware of Angular.js and Node.js like other people suggested
We haven't really talked about frameworks and such yet
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
I've been looking at react for front end and it seems to be easier to work in groups with because u can create components that don't conflict with each other
so for example one person can work on the side   bar and another on the header without conflictkng
but we would have to use node for back end
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Should I make a poll asking people what languages they know?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Sure and maybe if they are familiar with react/node/angular
I.e. any of the libraries/frameworks mentiones
DIM 15:23

Mathiaco-lee
I have a free one year of domain privacy
.com/ .net /.org
it might be able to use that
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
DIM 17:32

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
So what's our goal for Friday?
We should really decide on what frameworks we're using
DIM 18:53

Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
whatever you want guys!! doesnt matter for me
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I hoestly don't know enough about frameworks to have informed opinion. If there are group members that have opinions I am happy to go along with a decision and learn to use the framework.
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
^ not that experienced with frameworks so those who are can decide and ill start learning
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Or if none of us know, I am happy to research ones that were identified and discuss them.
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
Also for friday he wanted to see that we looked into the github api
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Another thing we might need to thing about are which user stories we are prioritising for sprint two so we can start splitting up and creating tasks.
As in he wants us to look at how the api might be useful?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
from what I'm seeing it's easier to learn PHP than node.js for the backend
but node.js is easier to host and better performance
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Do any of you know ruby on rails? Just curious as I have heard it being used often in the context of web apps
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w/playlists
Mindspace
There's always something to learn! Whether you want to have look at Angular 2 Tutorials or Guides, WordPress Tutorials, CSS/JavaScript Tutorials or anything ...
youtube.com
this guy has good videos for node/angular/react
MER 21:38

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Did any of you have a look at the grading scheme for sprint 2?
Mathiaco-lee
yess
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am little concerned that we have quite a bit to do.
In prep for Friday do each of us want to take on a few of the user stories for line 5 and line 6 of the grading for sprint 2?
Or do you all prefer to just work on it in a group?
At Friday's meeting I mean.
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I think there wont be much time before the tutorial on Friday
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am worried about the same thing.
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
So we should work on it at least tom
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I've been working on a rough draft of the website
like, how it looks.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
A wireframe?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
no, more than that
like actually coding it up
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
What frame work
Are u using
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
bootstrap
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am not sure who it was that had the outline for our work on paper from last Friday but was that uploaded?
Also, did we decided on Bootstrap as our framework?
*decide
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
can we decide if what we are going to use for front/back end of the project
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am assuming the first is what you have been testing out?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
What?
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
The first image
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I haven't done any backend
this is purely UI
with placeholders
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
That looks great!
I am really concerned, however, about meeting the requirements of the second sprint, which really requires us to drill down on the user stories.
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
second sprint is next friday
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
^
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Not this friday then
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Is anyone good at design in this group?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Design like for 2D
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
For webpages in general
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I know the second sprint is not till next Friday but I don't think the work is going to be done in a short period of time.
I also tend to be pretty busy so it's hard for me to do things last minute. I don't mind if other people want to work on their part later, I would just prefer to divide up the work at least
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Yeahh it will be great to know who do what
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah i agree
Too
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
So are we deciding this stuff Friday?
Emanuel Mateus
Emanuel
we should figure out the languages we use
then it would be much easier to determine the work everyone has to do
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Could we at least divide up the user stories and come in on Friday, each having looked at: 
Story description, Points, Risk, Priority, with burndown chart and Task breakdown for our user stories.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Yeah
Well there's like half of us that are able to meet on Friday right after class
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so for those of us that can't meet, can they post their part on gitHub for their selected user stories by Friday so at least we have their part to work with?
Perhaps we can choose the user stories we each on want to work on and mark that on github so we don't do doubles at least.
Mathiaco-lee
yeah that's a good plan
i am interested in the stories related to the using the Github API
JEU 11:46

Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Guys we need to plan things today
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Yeahhh
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Am at school if anybody is willing to join me
I'll make a plan and assign work that needs to be done and everybody can fill the task(s) they feel like they can do
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I created a file called framework
In code
Can everybody go there and fell it with the languages they know
And next to that their name
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Where is the file
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
In code
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
Ok
Ariles Jazilan
Ariles
done!!
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Please feel free to look up the tasks file
And update it since i am a little busy to write all the tasks we  need to do
Whenever we do a task we can write it over there and the contributors to it
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Guys we are going to decide the framework by 6 tonight
jeudi 9 février, à 18:00
Le groupe recevra aussi un rappel 30 min avant.
Yousef a créé un rappel pour l’évènement.
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
I think most people will accept node.js and react
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I'm in class at that time
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am goid with what ivan said
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Dude its 1 o clock
Diyaan Athar

Yousef Shaker
Yousef

Meeting chat records [21/2/2017]
Hi!
Jeff
Hello
:D
Mathiaco-lee
Hi
Emanuel
hi
Jeff, what has your progress been since Saturday?
And what are you hoping to get done by Saturday?
Jeff
I've watched all the nodejs videos Ivan gave me, and today I'm working posts
Ariles
Where are u ?!!
Where are you hoping to be at with this by the upcoming Saturday ?
Online...
Jeff
Tomorrow I want to see if we can create the database, and hopefully added the post to the database when the submit button is clicked
Ariles
Is not a person meeting?!
Jeff
I think Ariles is at school
Yousef
Am at school
Ariles
Yeahh i am at school
Okay, you and I can confer on this tomorrow!
Nathan how about you?
Emanuel
speaking of the database i've been doing some research and it looks like firebase is better suited to what we need, since it is better when real-time updates to the clients are required
Are you working on a particular user story?
Does anybody else know about firebase?
Jeff
I agree with firebase!
And I know how to use firebase 🙂
Emanuel
nice
Jeff
thank god
one less thing to learn
And google has some nice SHORT tutorial videos about it
Is there are consensus on this?
Mathiaco-lee
Good for me
Nathan?
Yousef?
Yousef
I guess everybody agrees on it
Arriles?
Yousef
Honestly I don't know what  firebase is
Do you know what Mongo DB is, or are they same for you?
Jeff
Firebase is just an online database made by google
Yousef, are you working on a particular story line?
Sorry I mean user story!
Yousef
Yeah the group pages
Okay, so where are you at with that?
Not trying to be mean 😕
Yousef
Almost done finishing the languages
I need
Jeff
I suggest everyone use the "Project" tab on github
I created a SCRUM board there to help keep track of what everyone is doing
Yousef, when do think you will be able to hav the React components done for the group page?
Jeff
You can drag and drop your User Story by clicking "Add Cards" and then drag and drop it
Cool! Thanks Jeff 🙂
Yousef
I should be able to let u know by after tom
Ariles
I dont know firebase !!
But you do know Mongo DB?
Ariles
Neither
But its fine
Jeff
:P
So is it the same for for you to use them Ariles?
Ariles
Use what?!
Database ?!
Firebase verses MongoDB
As in does it make a difference?
Ariles
Ohh yeahh in either case i need to learn one
Okay, whoever said they had a video tutorial can you please post it to the chat?
Ariles
You can use this website slant.io
To compare which one is the best
Slant.co
Mathiaco-lee, are you working on a user story?
Mathiaco-lee
On the github profile info and activities
Jeff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1D0_wFlXgo&t
Mathiaco-lee
I've started coding
What part are you coding? Do you have the React JS part up and running?
Mathiaco-lee
Not yet
Jeff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwNATxfUsgI&t
Do you think you will have that by Saturday?
Jeff
Actually I'll post these in the group.
THey'll get lost in the chat
Mathiaco-lee
I'll try my best
Thanks Mathiaco-lee! and also thanks Jeff!
Ariles, are you working on a user story?
Sorry y'all harassment will be over soon
Mathiaco-lee
Jeff these are the firebase videos ?
Hey Emanuel, are you working on a user story?
Emanuel
working on the user stories that allow real time chat between people
Jeff
Ok so I posted to useful videos about Firebase in the group page
There's plenty more on youtube that you can find
Emanuel
Nathan and I were able to get a basic functional chat down
and now we would need to connect to a database and find the best way to save chat files
Mathiaco-lee
Thanks
Do you think you will have that down by Saturday or you think that you will need more time?
Emanuel
Probably need a bit more time
Okay, so as an estimate, I will put down next Tuesday as a hope to get finished time. Is that okay?
Emanuel
sure
Ariles, where are you?
Mathiaco-lee
Does anyone have an idea of what is needed for Sprint 3 other than progress ?
Nope, just checking the site rn.
Nothing there on sprint 3 as of yet!
Okay, I think we are done, I gonna just transfer this to the meeting notes. Does anybody else have anything else they need to follow up on?
Emanuel
nope
Mathiaco-lee
Guess we will catch up on Saturday at 8 PM
Mathiaco-lee
Oh Yousef are you still doing the Burndown chart ?
Jeff, where to we do this dragging. I am super confused?
Jeff
Go to github
Click the Project tab
Then click "SCRUM Board"
The top right there's a button that says "Add Cards"
Cool, I can see it!
What does icebox mean?
Do all our user stories start ther?
Jeff
Technically every User Story we plan on doing should be in there
It's User stories that are waiting to be worked on
Okay got it! I will transfer them over
Nathan I think Emanuel gave us an update on the user story him and you are working on
Did you want to add anything?
Nathan
ya im reading srry im late
Np, it happens
Ivan I see you there 😛
Thanks for organizing the project folders
Which user stories precisely are you working on?
Ivan
Hey im back
Me?
Yup, you
Ivan
Working on the github stuff
You mean log-in with Mathiaco?
Ivan
Yeah
The login and creating a profile for the user
Jeff
Ivan I think the login isn't working anymore
Ivan
It works, sign out of github and u'll see
What will you have done by Saturday?
Jeff
oh yeah wow
cool
Did you change it?
Ivan
Sessions + profile page creation
Jeff
It doesn't show in the revoke page
Ivan
And I'll try to get the database stuff working
Jeff
We're using Firebase now I think
Ivan
I think its because it only asks for ur public info
Jeff
instead of MongoDB
Ah ok
Ivan
Ok
Does anyone want to setup the database stuff or should I do it?
Jeff
As in creating the database?
Ivan
Yeah
One thing I am really confused about is don't we need one database?
Jeff
Yeah
Ivan
Yeah
Correct
Jeff is that something you and I want to work on tomorrow since you already know how it works?
....just a suggestions...
Jeff
Sure
Okay, so how about once Jeff and I have met tomorrow we send everyone an update on what is going on with that?
I am guessing it is going to be pertinent to what you and Emanuel are doing also Nathan?
Nathan
yeah, well we havent really looked at any of the database stuff yet.
but thats what we are missing
Ivan
Database is very pertinent to all the aspects of the site
Okay, so Jeff and I will give y'all an update once we have met?
Ivan
Ok
Jeff
People need a Google account in order for me to add them to the database as Admins
as in a @gmail.com email

Or if neither of those, then what date is realistic?
Ariles
Ariles

Jeff
Ok so everyone should be able to see the database at https://console.firebase.google.com/
Firebase Console

accounts.google.com
Just look at it when you have the time
Ariles

Or did we just copy-paste last time?
I mean from facebook, sorry if that was confusing?
Mathiaco-lee

Nathan

Ivan is the token you receive from gitHub stored in a cookie?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Right now its not stored anywhere
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Then how does it know if we are logged in or not
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
It doesn't xD
You can get in without logging in
There's no sessions or cookies or verifications
But it gets an access token from github
Right now the access token is just written to the console and it disappears
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
But technically the access token could be stored and reused?
Do we get  a different access token every time we login?
Nathan & Emanuel, do you get a chance to integrate your chat with the overall website. If not, could you please do this by Saturday at the very latest as it would be great to see it and how it fits in with the rest of the site.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Please carefully read the post I made on the group page as it details what you need to do by our Saturday meeting. Please come prepared.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am going through the user stories, and some of you still have not fixed up your user stories. Each user story needs to have a description, and an accurate task breakdown besides it.
Ivan & Mathiaco: You have been assigned to user stories #14, #16, #17. Your user stories have not been touched so could you please make sure that they meet all the criteria above by Saturday 8 PM.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I'll look at it when I get home
I didn't touch any of mine either I think
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Perfect, thanks Jeff!
Matuese and Nathan: you guys are set 🙂
Ariles, you are assigned to User Story#22. Your user story has also not been touched. Please make sure that it meets all the criteria I mentioned above by Saturday 8 PM.
Yousef: You have no user stories in the In Progress part of the SCRUM board

Yousef Shaker

Okay
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Thanks Yousef!
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Hi y'all, since I am in full harassment mode, I uploaded a task list to our Facebook page based on our conversations. Please make sure you come to our Saturday meeting prepared.
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Awesome job!
FEB 22ND, 10:43PM

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I was taking a look at our overall sprints, and the sprint we have coming up is focussed on features so I think we should really be pushing ourselves to get the site functional over the next week and a half.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Ok
FEB 24TH, 5:04PM

Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Hey did anyone have any success with Firebase? I can't figure it out
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
What's confusing you
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
I can't get it to put anything in the database
I've been messing around with it for a few hours today and yesterday
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Have you watched tutorials?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
yeah
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
You added the code that connects it to the db?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Do you get errors when you try to store data?
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
got it to work 😀
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
What was wrong
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
It was giving me initializatiogn errors
either my code was initializing twice
or it was trying to run withotu initializing
I kinda quickfixed it
but it worked 😀
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
How?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yaw guys i want to update my branch but whenever i switch to another branch to make a pull request it trlls me aborting
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I think someone else needs to pull
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
aborting?
what does it say exactly
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
When I switch from master to my branch it shows me this

Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
try git stash
then switch
> git stash
> git checkout your-branch
Yousef Shaker
Yousef

This appeared when u stash
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
I have no idea
lol
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Omg
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
do u have any changes on ur branch u need?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
I want to update my branch
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
you want your branch to be synced with master?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah
Just a sec i think i figured it
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout <YOUR-BRANCH>
git merge master
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Will am trying to do that
But i cant switch
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
you can't git checkout master?
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Yeah
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
thats wierd
google it
it shouldnt be a problem
if anythign you can always make a new branch
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
You can use the GUI version of git if you want
I find it easier
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Will i am learning
But i think i found the problem
Since this is concordia's computer it has limited disk
So i deleted the files
And it worked fine
But i still can t switch due to
Memory consumption
I did a pull request
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
lol
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Ivan if i want to change my file
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
dude
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Sorry
I know
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
we can't merge because you're changing a file taht is long gone
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Its supposed
So should i delete
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
just delete yeah
and clone the repo again
and start a new branch
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
Done

Diyaan
Okay, we will wait a couple of minutes before getting started I guess?
Okay so Mathiaco-lee are you working with Ivan?
I saw your name on the same user stories as Ivan so I am wondering if you are working with him or independently?
Mathiaco-lee Bessane
Mathiaco-lee
I've been working on some stuff but we'll merge it
there's some stuff i want done first
but I am not done yet
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Could you tell me exactly what you are working on?
Mathiaco-lee Bessane
Mathiaco-lee
so Ivan is that alright with you
?
the profile info and activities taken from github
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
But you haven't talked to Ivan about what he is doing?
What is you both are doubling up on work?

I think Mathiaco-Lee and Ivan were giving updates on their user stories
Mathiaco, what exactly have you done? [i.e. React, HTML, CSS, Firebase]
And for which pages?
Mathiaco-lee Bessane
Mathiaco-lee
the user story that is saying i want my github activity available on profile
node.js and then firebase
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, so not the log-in page. I think you are working on that right Ivan?
Mathiaco-lee Bessane
Mathiaco-lee
yes he did it
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Perfect. So what is remaining on that user story and when will have you that code-base ready to merge with the rest of the teams?
I am asking as I am pretty sure in our next sprint we will need to demonstrate features of our site.
Mathiaco-lee Bessane
Mathiaco-lee
I updated the user stories last time with description and task list
next meeting is on Tuesday
i think I'll be good
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
So you will have it ready to merge by Tuesday?
Mathiaco-lee Bessane
Mathiaco-lee

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
:)

Ariles
Mathiaco-lee Bessane
Mathiaco-lee
Jeff and Ivan, so the plan for the commits graph is to take the data and do it on html? because it is not possiblle to use the API for this
as we were discussing last time
MAR 24TH, 10:23AM

Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
Yeah we'll make our own graphs

Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
You referenced a user story that is closed eh
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Yeah, I realized I accidentally referenced a wrong user story, but I don't know how to fix it!
I guess I can put a comment on the commit!
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Also, all testing should be done on your branch before moving it to master
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I was having a a problem with that, thus the pull request. I am sorry
MAR 24TH, 8:12PM

Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
did someone move the users in the db?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
No?
Did they get deleted again
Yeah they did
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
no they are under classes, was it like that before
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Wtf is happening
Yeah it was
That shows the users in that class
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
ya ok thats fine, i thought I saw it not under classes before
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
But the users got deleted in the other tree
Now it only shows Ivan
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
It was me!!!
I deleted the users
had to
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Ok lmao
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
I'm going to make a pull request
so that the users thing doesnt need to be deleted
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I thought it was the bug that happened this morning
Ivan Bogdev
Ivan
this morning was different

Jeff Buonamici

MAR 26TH, 2:00PM

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Is one of you adding documents to our firebase DB?
MAR 26TH, 3:18PM

Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Hey ivan did you just add the functionality for #27? Because I spent the entire weekend working on that like I said I would
Ariles
nadia !!! i did the uploading part !!! missing just to retrieve the files and put it on the page based on the url !!!
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay that really sucks because I wasted an entire weekend after specifically telling you I was doing
You could have at least had the courtesy to tell before hand. We had this discussion just on Friday
I could have worked on something else
That's the whole point of the group chat and communication.
Ariles
exuse me but if you go to scrum board you can see who is assign to what and second i just wanted to help to finish and thirdly i spent more than 3 weeks
to learn react
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Then when we talk about it on thursday and friday you let me know
Ariles
and jeff did the part so i am not upset is a group project
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
I am upset because we are close to the end and I would rather have worked on an item that was actually useful.
Ariles
ok
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Is there something someone is not working on that I can contribute to? I would rather not waste more time if I can help it.
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
This is why we shouldn't leave things to the last minute.
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Agreed, but as we have. Is there something that you are working on Jeff that I can help with? Or one of your tasks I can take over.
Have you started working on adding groups yet?
Or can I work on that?
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I'm not touching this project until Tuesday night.
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
im working on creating groups within classes almost done
however we still have nothing on the group pages
so you can make something that reads from the database to create groups in the group pages
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
what exactly do you mean by that?
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
well so far i created something where you can select members from your class to form groups and it saves it in the database
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, sure. I can work on that.
I have to step out rn but I will ask you for more details when I get back.
Ariles
**the way how the Ta view the page and student should be different!!! and there should be connection!!!
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Actually, maybe I can add the send documents functionality to the chat since I figure out how to do that. @Ariles Jazilan is that okay with you?
Ariles
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay, perfect!
@Nathan Shummoogum we don't have that functionality do we?
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
nope we dont
Diyaan Athar
Diyaan
Okay great, I update the SCRUM board to reflect that.

Guys
We need to be careful with what we're commiting
Someone overwrote all changes done in classes.js and now it's an older version of what it was.
Yousef Shaker
Yousef
What
Who
Shit
We re still going to meet tomorrow guys right
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Also, did someone change it so that firebase is initialized on the backend automatically?
Ariles
I dont know but now its not displaying the create class
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
@Nathan Shummoogum I think you accidently changed classes.ejs on your branch because it has a lot of similar code to classpage.ejs now
It's weird
i made a pull request to reverted changes on master for Classes.ejs and Classes.js
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
oh maybe i accidentally changed it, there shouldnt be any changed in classes.js/ejs only classpage
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Emmanuel changed classes.js to an old version,
You haven't changed anything on master. But on your branch, classes.ejs is messed up
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
k ill update my branch
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Did you change how firebase is initialized on pages?
MAR 29TH, 5:18PM

Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
emanuel changed it
he made a firebase.js file
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
I'm gonna make it so that only a TA can delete groups on the classpage
is that ok with you?
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
i didnt make anyhting for the delete yet
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
oh, so the button doesn't do anything
Nathan Shummoogum
Nathan
nope, left it there as a reminder to add that functionality
Jeff Buonamici
Jeff
Ok, I'll work on it
I'm gonna make a pull request so you can see some of the changes i've made.
MAR 29TH, 9:42PM

When someone accesses the class page, we need to check if the user logged on is actually in the class
If not, they should be redirected back to classes.ejs
because right now you can access any class by changing the URL

Message to TA: 
Hello,

After reading the professor's email, we'd like to postpone the last sprint meeting if possible. 
Would it be possible to postpone the meeting until Wednesday, April 12?
Our preferred time would be at 12:30, but any other time would probably do.

Would it be possible to arrange that? 

Thank you, 
Ivan Bogdev
