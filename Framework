Java php sql javascript
I agree with Emanuel node.js and react is good!!! for the front-end ---> angular js or bootstrap or w3.css
W3.CSS is a modern CSS framework with built-in responsiveness: for more info : http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp

  -Node.js
  -React  
  (I personally think we should use node.js for the back end and react for the front end (which is a framework for javascript) after doing 
  some research, I think it would be best for the project and also for future experience in the industry).
