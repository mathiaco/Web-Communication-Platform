webpack.config.js is included, needed for react,

so that react works, the commands to install all packages are necessary;
-npm init (intialize npm, create a package.json file (can just leave the defaults))
-npm install react react-dom --save
-npm install webpack webpack-dev-server babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-2 --save-dev

a folder "src" folder will also need to be created with index.html and an "app" folder that contains index.js
the names can be changed but the webpack.config.js file will need to be changed respectively
